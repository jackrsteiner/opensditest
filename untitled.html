<div>This initial version of an SDI cookbook for New Zealand has been developed to provide guidance for the early stages of implementing a national SDI. These chapters are based on what is currently known about the elements typically underpinningSDIs and guided by developments and experiences in jurisdictions internationally.</div><div>The approach presented in this cookbook recognises the contemporary geographical information systems in New Zealand organisations and how modern information architectures increasingly support aspects of SDI.</div><div>This document has been developed along the lines of other geospatial reference documents like the GSDI cookbook. The chapters can be read individually,or in whichever order suits the reader.</div><div>As a minimum, the guidance here provides initial steps and consideratioins so that willing organisations can commence their journey towards active participation in the national SDI.</div><div>Invitation to participate and provide feedback</div><div>This initial version of the cookbook has been developed with the help of members of the wider geospatial community. As such, it should be considered a work-in- progress. We intend to keep adding and building on this document, with the help of your valuable feedback.</div><div>As part of their community engagement activities, New Zealand Geospatial Of ce staff will present material within this cookbook to a wide range of audiences or as appropriate, arrange training on aspects of the cookbook. A formal consultation process will also be put in place, particularly to address critical elements of the SDI such as the development of community data speci cations. The feedback from these engagement opportunities will help shape future versions of this cookbook.</div><div>We’re really keen to hear your thoughts.
